This project is a Python-based desktop application that performs automatic text summarization using a pre-trained Natural Language Processing (NLP) model from Hugging Face Transformers. It uses the sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6 model, which is a lightweight version of BART fine-tuned for summarization tasks. The application features a user-friendly graphical interface built with Tkinter, allowing users to input long passages of text and receive a concise summary instantly. This tool demonstrates how AI can simplify information extraction from unstructured data and has real-world use cases in domains like content review, customer feedback summarization, and business reporting
